Document: REGULATION (EU) GDPR.txt
- (6)

Rapid technological developments and globalisation have brought new challenges for the protection of personal
data.
- Technology allows both
private companies and public authorities to make use of personal data on an unprecedented scale in order to
pursue their activities.
- Technology has transformed both the economy and social life, and should further facilitate the free flow of
personal data within the Union and the transfer to third countries and international organisations, while ensuring
a high level of the protection of personal data.
- Regarding the
processing of personal data for compliance with a legal obligation, for the performance of a task carried out in
the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller, Member States should be
allowed to maintain or introduce national provisions to further specify the application of the rules of this
Regulation.
- Effective protection of personal data throughout the Union requires the strengthening and setting out in detail of
the rights of data subjects and the obligations of those who process and determine the processing of personal
data, as well as equivalent powers for monitoring and ensuring compliance with the rules for the protection of
personal data and equivalent sanctions for infringements in the Member States.
- It should be possible to entrust supervision of such data processing operations to specific bodies within
the judicial system of the Member State, which should, in particular ensure compliance with the rules of this
Regulation, enhance awareness among members of the judiciary of their obligations under this Regulation and
handle complaints in relation to such data processing operations.
- To ascertain whether means are reasonably likely to be used to identify the natural person, account
should be taken of all objective factors, such as the costs of and the amount of time required for identification,
taking into consideration the available technology at the time of the processing and technological developments.
- (34)

Genetic data should be defined as personal data relating to the inherited or acquired genetic characteristics of a
natural person which result from the analysis of a biological sample from the natural person in question, in
particular chromosomal, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or ribonucleic acid (RNA) analysis, or from the analysis of
another element enabling equivalent information to be obtained.
- This
includes information about the natural person collected in the course of the registration for, or the provision of,
health care services as referred to in Directive 2011/24/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (1) to
that natural person; a number, symbol or particular assigned to a natural person to uniquely identify the natural
person for health purposes; information derived from the testing or examination of a body part or bodily
substance, including from genetic data and biological samples; and any information on, for example, a disease,
disability, disease risk, medical history, clinical treatment or the physiological or biomedical state of the data
subject independent of its source, for example from a physician or other health professional, a hospital, a medical
device or an in vitro diagnostic test.
- The presence and use of
technical means and technologies for processing personal data or processing activities do not, in themselves,
constitute a main establishment and are therefore not determining criteria for a main establishment.
- In order for processing to be lawful, personal data should be processed on the basis of the consent of the data
subject concerned or some other legitimate basis, laid down by law, either in this Regulation or in other Union or

L 119/8

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

4.5.2016

Member State law as referred to in this Regulation, including the necessity for compliance with the legal
obligation to which the controller is subject or the necessity for the performance of a contract to which the data
subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract.
- (49)

The processing of personal data to the extent strictly necessary and proportionate for the purposes of ensuring
network and information security, i.e. the ability of a network or an information system to resist, at a given level
of confidence, accidental events or unlawful or malicious actions that compromise the availability, authenticity,
integrity and confidentiality of stored or transmitted personal data, and the security of the related services offered
by, or accessible via, those networks and systems, by public authorities, by computer emergency response teams
(CERTs), computer security incident response teams (CSIRTs), by providers of electronic communications
networks and services and by providers of security technologies and services, constitutes a legitimate interest of
the data controller concerned.
- Such personal data should not be processed, unless processing is allowed in
specific cases set out in this Regulation, taking into account that Member States law may lay down specific
provisions on data protection in order to adapt the application of the rules of this Regulation for compliance
with a legal obligation or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of
official authority vested in the controller.
- Identification should include the digital identification of a data subject, for example through authentication
mechanism such as the same credentials, used by the data subject to log-in to the on-line service offered by the
data controller.
- This is of particular relevance in situations where the proliferation of
actors and the technological complexity of practice make it difficult for the data subject to know and understand
whether, by whom and for what purpose personal data relating to him or her are being collected, such as in the
case of online advertising.
- Every data subject should
therefore have the right to know and obtain communication in particular with regard to the purposes for which
the personal data are processed, where possible the period for which the personal data are processed, the
recipients of the personal data, the logic involved in any automatic personal data processing and, at least when
based on profiling, the consequences of such processing.
- (65)

A data subject should have the right to have personal data concerning him or her rectified and a ‘right to be
forgotten’ where the retention of such data infringes this Regulation or Union or Member State law to which the
controller is subject.
- However, the further retention of the personal data
should be lawful where it is necessary, for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information, for
compliance with a legal obligation, for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the
exercise of official authority vested in the controller, on the grounds of public interest in the area of public
health, for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical
purposes, or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
- In
doing so, that controller should take reasonable steps, taking into account available technology and the means
available to the controller, including technical measures, to inform the controllers which are processing the
personal data of the data subject's request.
- It
should therefore not apply where the processing of the personal data is necessary for compliance with a legal
obligation to which the controller is subject or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or
in the exercise of an official authority vested in the controller.
- (73)

Restrictions concerning specific principles and the rights of information, access to and rectification or erasure of
personal data, the right to data portability, the right to object, decisions based on profiling, as well as the
communication of a personal data breach to a data subject and certain related obligations of the controllers may
be imposed by Union or Member State law, as far as necessary and proportionate in a democratic society to
safeguard public security, including the protection of human life especially in response to natural or manmade
disasters, the prevention, investigation and prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal
penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security, or of breaches of
ethics for regulated professions, other important objectives of general public interest of the Union or of a
Member State, in particular an important economic or financial interest of the Union or of a Member State, the
keeping of public registers kept for reasons of general public interest, further processing of archived personal data
to provide specific information related to the political behaviour under former totalitarian state regimes or the
protection of the data subject or the rights and freedoms of others, including social protection, public health and
humanitarian purposes.
- In particular, the controller should be obliged to implement
appropriate and effective measures and be able to demonstrate the compliance of processing activities with this
Regulation, including the effectiveness of the measures.
- (77)

Guidance on the implementation of appropriate measures and on the demonstration of compliance by the
controller or the processor, especially as regards the identification of the risk related to the processing, their
assessment in terms of origin, nature, likelihood and severity, and the identification of best practices to mitigate
the risk, could be provided in particular by means of approved codes of conduct, approved certifications,
guidelines provided by the Board or indications provided by a data protection officer.
- In order to be able to demonstrate compliance with this Regulation, the controller should
adopt internal policies and implement measures which meet in particular the principles of data protection by
design and data protection by default.
- Such a representative should perform its tasks according to the mandate received from the controller
or processor, including cooperating with the competent supervisory authorities with regard to any action taken
to ensure compliance with this Regulation.
- The designated representative should be subject to enforcement
proceedings in the event of non-compliance by the controller or processor.
- (81)

To ensure compliance with the requirements of this Regulation in respect of the processing to be carried out by
the processor on behalf of the controller, when entrusting a processor with processing activities, the controller
should use only processors providing sufficient guarantees, in particular in terms of expert knowledge, reliability
and resources, to implement technical and organisational measures which will meet the requirements of this
Regulation, including for the security of processing.
- The adherence of the processor to an approved code of
conduct or an approved certification mechanism may be used as an element to demonstrate compliance with the
obligations of the controller.
- (82)

In order to demonstrate compliance with this Regulation, the controller or processor should maintain records of
processing activities under its responsibility.
- (84)

In order to enhance compliance with this Regulation where processing operations are likely to result in a high
risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller should be responsible for the carrying-out of a
data protection impact assessment to evaluate, in particular, the origin, nature, particularity and severity of that
risk.
- Where a
data-protection impact assessment indicates that processing operations involve a high risk which the controller
cannot mitigate by appropriate measures in terms of available technology and costs of implementation, a
consultation of the supervisory authority should take place prior to the processing.
- (85)

A personal data breach may, if not addressed in an appropriate and timely manner, result in physical, material or
non-material damage to natural persons such as loss of control over their personal data or limitation of their
rights, discrimination, identity theft or fraud, financial loss, unauthorised reversal of pseudonymisation, damage
to reputation, loss of confidentiality of personal data protected by professional secrecy or any other significant
economic or social disadvantage to the natural person concerned.
- Therefore, as soon as the controller becomes

4.5.2016

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

L 119/17

aware that a personal data breach has occurred, the controller should notify the personal data breach to the
supervisory authority without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after having become
aware of it, unless the controller is able to demonstrate, in accordance with the accountability principle, that the
personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.
- The controller should communicate to the data subject a personal data breach, without undue delay, where that
personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of the natural person in order to
allow him or her to take the necessary precautions.
- The communication should describe the nature of the
personal data breach as well as recommendations for the natural person concerned to mitigate potential adverse
effects.
- For example, the need to mitigate an immediate risk of damage would call
for prompt communication with data subjects whereas the need to implement appropriate measures against
continuing or similar personal data breaches may justify more time for communication.
- (87)

It should be ascertained whether all appropriate technological protection and organisational measures have been
implemented to establish immediately whether a personal data breach has taken place and to inform promptly
the supervisory authority and the data subject.
- The fact that the notification was made without undue delay
should be established taking into account in particular the nature and gravity of the personal data breach and its
consequences and adverse effects for the data subject.
- In setting detailed rules concerning the format and procedures applicable to the notification of personal data
breaches, due consideration should be given to the circumstances of that breach, including whether or not
personal data had been protected by appropriate technical protection measures, effectively limiting the likelihood
of identity fraud or other forms of misuse.
- Moreover, such rules and procedures should take into account the
legitimate interests of law-enforcement authorities where early disclosure could unnecessarily hamper the investi­
gation of the circumstances of a personal data breach.
- Such types of processing operations may be those which in,
particular, involve using new technologies, or are of a new kind and where no data protection impact assessment
has been carried out before by the controller, or where they become necessary in the light of the time that has
elapsed since the initial processing.
- That impact assessment should include, in
particular, the measures, safeguards and mechanisms envisaged for mitigating that risk, ensuring the protection of
personal data and demonstrating compliance with this Regulation.
- (91)

This should in particular apply to large-scale processing operations which aim to process a considerable amount
of personal data at regional, national or supranational level and which could affect a large number of data
subjects and which are likely to result in a high risk, for example, on account of their sensitivity, where in
accordance with the achieved state of technological knowledge a new technology is used on a large scale as well
as to other processing operations which result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects, in
particular where those operations render it more difficult for data subjects to exercise their rights.
- (94)

Where a data protection impact assessment indicates that the processing would, in the absence of safeguards,
security measures and mechanisms to mitigate the risk, result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural
persons and the controller is of the opinion that the risk cannot be mitigated by reasonable means in terms of
available technologies and costs of implementation, the supervisory authority should be consulted prior to the
start of processing activities.
- (95)

The processor should assist the controller, where necessary and upon request, in ensuring compliance with the
obligations deriving from the carrying out of data protection impact assessments and from prior consultation of
the supervisory authority.
- (96)

A consultation of the supervisory authority should also take place in the course of the preparation of a legislative
or regulatory measure which provides for the processing of personal data, in order to ensure compliance of the
intended processing with this Regulation and in particular to mitigate the risk involved for the data subject.
- (97)

Where the processing is carried out by a public authority, except for courts or independent judicial authorities
when acting in their judicial capacity, where, in the private sector, processing is carried out by a controller whose
core activities consist of processing operations that require regular and systematic monitoring of the data subjects
on a large scale, or where the core activities of the controller or the processor consist of processing on a large
scale of special categories of personal data and data relating to criminal convictions and offences, a person with
expert knowledge of data protection law and practices should assist the controller or processor to monitor
internal compliance with this Regulation.
- In order to enhance transparency and compliance with this Regulation, the establishment of certification
mechanisms and data protection seals and marks should be encouraged, allowing data subjects to quickly assess
the level of data protection of relevant products and services.
- In any
event, transfers to third countries and international organisations may only be carried out in full compliance with
this Regulation.
- The
Commission should evaluate, within a reasonable time, the functioning of the latter decisions and report any
relevant findings to the Committee within the meaning of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European
Parliament and of the Council (1) as established under this Regulation, to the European Parliament and to the
Council.
- Those safeguards should ensure compliance with data protection
requirements and the rights of the data subjects appropriate to processing within the Union, including the
availability of enforceable data subject rights and of effective legal remedies, including to obtain effective adminis­
trative or judicial redress and to claim compensation, in the Union or in a third country.
- They should relate in
particular to compliance with the general principles relating to personal data processing, the principles of data
protection by design and by default.
- The extraterritorial application of those laws, regulations and other legal acts may be in
breach of international law and may impede the attainment of the protection of natural persons ensured in the
Union by this Regulation.
- The controller or processor should take the necessary measures to ensure
compliance with this Regulation and the implementation of the decision notified by the lead supervisory
authority to the main establishment of the controller or processor as regards the processing activities in the
Union.
- In particular each measure should be appropriate, necessary and proportionate in view of
ensuring compliance with this Regulation, taking into account the circumstances of each individual case, respect
the right of every person to be heard before any individual measure which would affect him or her adversely is
taken and avoid superfluous costs and excessive inconveniences for the persons concerned.
- The staff of
the European Data Protection Supervisor involved in carrying out the tasks conferred on the Board by this
Regulation should perform its tasks exclusively under the instructions of, and report to, the Chair of the Board.
- Due regard should however be given to the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement, the
intentional character of the infringement, actions taken to mitigate the damage suffered, degree of responsibility
or any relevant previous infringements, the manner in which the infringement became known to the supervisory
authority, compliance with measures ordered against the controller or processor, adherence to a code of conduct
and any other aggravating or mitigating factor.
- However, the imposition of criminal penalties for infringements of such national rules and of
administrative penalties should not lead to a breach of the principle of ne bis in idem, as interpreted by the Court
of Justice.
- L 119/28

infringements and the upper limit and criteria for setting the related administrative fines, which should be
determined by the competent supervisory authority in each individual case, taking into account all relevant
circumstances of the specific situation, with due regard in particular to the nature, gravity and duration of the
infringement and of its consequences and the measures taken to ensure compliance with the obligations under
this Regulation and to prevent or mitigate the consequences of the infringement.
- For the purposes of this Regulation, the processing of personal data for scientific research purposes
should be interpreted in a broad manner including for example technological development and demonstration,
fundamental research, applied research and privately funded research.
- This should also include historical research and research for genealogical purposes, bearing in mind
that this Regulation should not apply to deceased persons.
- Article 4

subject's wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the
processing of personal data relating to him or her;
(12) ‘personal data breach’ means a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration,
unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed;
(13) ‘genetic data’ means personal data relating to the inherited or acquired genetic characteristics of a natural person
which give unique information about the physiology or the health of that natural person and which result, in
particular, from an analysis of a biological sample from the natural person in question;
(14) ‘biometric data’ means personal data resulting from specific technical processing relating to the physical, physio­
logical or behavioural characteristics of a natural person, which allow or confirm the unique identification of that
natural person, such as facial images or dactyloscopic data;

tration in the Union, unless the decisions on the purposes and means of the processing of personal data are
taken in another establishment of the controller in the Union and the latter establishment has the power to
have such decisions implemented, in which case the establishment having taken such decisions is to be
considered to be the main establishment;
(b) as regards a processor with establishments in more than one Member State, the place of its central adminis­
tration in the Union, or, if the processor has no central administration in the Union, the establishment of the
processor in the Union where the main processing activities in the context of the activities of an establishment
of the processor take place to the extent that the processor is subject to specific obligations under this
Regulation;
(17) ‘representative’ means a natural or legal person established in the Union who, designated by the controller or
processor in writing pursuant to Article 27, represents the controller or processor with regard to their respective

4.5.2016

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

L 119/35

(22) ‘supervisory authority concerned’ means a supervisory authority which is concerned by the processing of personal
data because:
(a) the controller or processor is established on the territory of the Member State of that supervisory authority;
(b) data subjects residing in the Member State of that supervisory authority are substantially affected or likely to be
substantially affected by the processing; or
(c) a complaint has been lodged with that supervisory authority;
(23) ‘cross-border processing’ means either:
(a) processing of personal data which takes place in the context of the activities of establishments in more than
one Member State of a controller or processor in the Union where the controller or processor is established in
more than one Member State; or
(b) processing of personal data which takes place in the context of the activities of a single establishment of a
controller or processor in the Union but which substantially affects or is likely to substantially affect data
subjects in more than one Member State.
- The controller shall be responsible for, and be able to demonstrate compliance with, paragraph 1 (‘accountability’).
- Processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that at least one of the following applies:

(a) the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes;
(b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps
at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract;

authority vested in the controller;
(f) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party,
except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject
which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.
- 2.
Member States may maintain or introduce more specific provisions to adapt the application of the rules of this
Regulation with regard to processing for compliance with points (c) and (e) of paragraph 1 by determining more
precisely specific requirements for the processing and other measures to ensure lawful and fair processing including for
other specific processing situations as provided for in Chapter IX.
3.
- The controller shall make reasonable efforts to verify in such cases that consent is given or authorised by the
holder of parental responsibility over the child, taking into consideration available technology.
- In addition to the information referred to in paragraph 1, the controller shall, at the time when personal data are
obtained, provide the data subject with the following further information necessary to ensure fair and transparent
processing:
(a) the period for which the personal data will be stored, or if that is not possible, the criteria used to determine that
period;
(b) the existence of the right to request from the controller access to and rectification or erasure of personal data or
restriction of processing concerning the data subject or to object to processing as well as the right to data
portability;
(c) where the processing is based on point (a) of Article 6(1) or point (a) of Article 9(2), the existence of the right to
withdraw consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal;
(d) the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority;
(e) whether the provision of personal data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter
into a contract, as well as whether the data subject is obliged to provide the personal data and of the possible
consequences of failure to provide such data;
(f) the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, referred to in Article 22(1) and (4) and, at least in
those cases, meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged
consequences of such processing for the data subject.
- In addition to the information referred to in paragraph 1, the controller shall provide the data subject with the
following information necessary to ensure fair and transparent processing in respect of the data subject:
(a) the period for which the personal data will be stored, or if that is not possible, the criteria used to determine that
period;
(b) where the processing is based on point (f) of Article 6(1), the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a
third party;
(c) the existence of the right to request from the controller access to and rectification or erasure of personal data or
restriction of processing concerning the data subject and to object to processing as well as the right to data
portability;
(d) where processing is based on point (a) of Article 6(1) or point (a) of Article 9(2), the existence of the right to
withdraw consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal;
(e) the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority;
(f) from which source the personal data originate, and if applicable, whether it came from publicly accessible sources;
(g) the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, referred to in Article 22(1) and (4) and, at least in
those cases, meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged
consequences of such processing for the data subject.
- The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller confirmation as to whether or not personal data
concerning him or her are being processed, and, where that is the case, access to the personal data and the following
information:
(a) the purposes of the processing;
(b) the categories of personal data concerned;
(c) the recipients or categories of recipient to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed, in particular
recipients in third countries or international organisations;
(d) where possible, the envisaged period for which the personal data will be stored, or, if not possible, the criteria used
to determine that period;
(e) the existence of the right to request from the controller rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of
processing of personal data concerning the data subject or to object to such processing;
(f) the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority;
(g) where the personal data are not collected from the data subject, any available information as to their source;
(h) the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, referred to in Article 22(1) and (4) and, at least in
those cases, meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged
consequences of such processing for the data subject.
- The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data concerning him or
her without undue delay and the controller shall have the obligation to erase personal data without undue delay where
one of the following grounds applies:
(a) the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise
processed;

L 119/44

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

4.5.2016

(b) the data subject withdraws consent on which the processing is based according to point (a) of Article 6(1), or
point (a) of Article 9(2), and where there is no other legal ground for the processing;
(c) the data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(1) and there are no overriding legitimate grounds
for the processing, or the data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(2);
(d) the personal data have been unlawfully processed;
(e) the personal data have to be erased for compliance with a legal obligation in Union or Member State law to which
the controller is subject;
(f) the personal data have been collected in relation to the offer of information society services referred to in
Article 8(1).
- 2.
Where the controller has made the personal data public and is obliged pursuant to paragraph 1 to erase the
personal data, the controller, taking account of available technology and the cost of implementation, shall take
reasonable steps, including technical measures, to inform controllers which are processing the personal data that the
data subject has requested the erasure by such controllers of any links to, or copy or replication of, those personal data.
3.
- Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to the extent that processing is necessary:

(a) for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information;
(b) for compliance with a legal obligation which requires processing by Union or Member State law to which the
controller is subject or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official
authority vested in the controller;
(c) for reasons of public interest in the area of public health in accordance with points (h) and (i) of Article 9(2) as well
as Article 9(3);
(d) for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes in
accordance with Article 89(1) in so far as the right referred to in paragraph 1 is likely to render impossible or
seriously impair the achievement of the objectives of that processing; or
(e) for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.

Appendix A:
- As cloud
computing is still an evolving technology, evaluations of risks and benefits may change as the technology
becomes more established and its implications become better understood.
- Clear policies and procedures should be
agreed between client and cloud provider for all security requirements, and responsibilities for operation,
management and reporting should be clearly defined and understood for each requirement.
- 1.1

Intended Use
This document provides guidance on the use of cloud technologies and considerations for maintaining PCI
DSS controls in cloud environments.
- This guidance builds on that provided in the PCI DSS Virtualization
Guidelines and is intended for organizations using, or thinking of using, providing, or assessing cloud
technologies as part of a cardholder data environment (CDE).
- 

PCI DSS Compliance Challenges – Describes some of the challenges associated with validating PCI
DSS compliance in a cloud environment.
- 

Additional Security Considerations – Explores a number of business and technical security
considerations for the use of cloud technologies.
- This document does not endorse the use of any specific
technologies, products, or services.
- Guidance for working with third-party cloud providers and PCI DSS compliance
challenges may also be useful.
- Guidance on CSP/client relationships and PCI DSS compliance
challenges may also be useful for providers.
- 1.3

Terminology
The following terms are used throughout this document:

2



CSP – Cloud Service Provider.
- Cloud computing can be used to provide clients with access to the latest technologies without a costly
investment in hardware and software.
- Due to the economies of scale associated with the delivery of cloud
services, CSPs can often provide access to a greater range of technologies and security resources than the
client might otherwise have access to.
- 

Community cloud – The cloud infrastructure is shared by several organizations and supports a specific
community with shared requirements or concerns (for example, business model, security requirements,
policy, or compliance considerations).
- 

Hybrid cloud – The cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more clouds (private, community, or
public) that remain unique entities but are bound together by technology to enable portability.
- Clear
policies and procedures should be agreed upon between client and cloud provider for all security
requirements, and clear responsibilities for operation, management and reporting need to be defined for each
requirement.

3.2

Roles and Responsibilities for Different Deployments Models
- In this scenario, the client organization retains full control of their
environment and its security and compliance.
- However, it’s important to note that the
technology layers and their corresponding lines of responsibility may be different for each CSP,
even if they use the same terminology to describe their service, and the individual service offerings
may or may not align with the responsibly assignments indicated above.
- 

The scope of any additional services the CSP is providing to proactively manage the client’s compliance
(for example, additional managed security services).
- Information provided here does not replace
or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard.

11

Information Supplement • PCI DSS Cloud Computing Guidelines • February 2013

Where the CSP maintains responsibility for PCI DSS controls, the client is still responsible for monitoring the
CSP’s ongoing compliance for all applicable requirements.
- CSPs should be able to provide their clients with
ongoing assurance that requirements are being met, and where the CSP is managing requirements on behalf
of the client, they should have mechanisms in place to provide the customer with the applicable records—for
example, audit logs showing all access to client data.
- Clients are still required to validate their compliance in accordance with payment brand programs.
- Information provided here does not replace
or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard.

12

Information Supplement • PCI DSS Cloud Computing Guidelines • February 2013



Environments where clients run their applications in separate logical partitions using separate database
management system images and do not share disk storage or other resources.
- Without adequate segmentation, all clients of the shared infrastructure, as well as the CSP, would need to be
verified as being PCI DSS compliant in order for any one client to be assured of the compliance of the
environment.
- This will likely make compliance validation unachievable for the CSP or any of their clients.
- Applicable PCI DSS controls for the segmentation functions would also be the CSP’s
responsibility (for example, firewall rules, audit logging, documentation, reviews, etc.).
- 4.4.3

Segmentation Technologies
Traditional network segmentation technologies consist of hardware devices such as firewalls, switches,
routers, and so forth.
- Examples of controls to be considered when evaluating segmentation options include, but are not limited
to:


Physical firewalls and network segmentation at the infrastructure level



Firewalls at the hypervisor and VM level



VLAN tagging or zoning in addition to firewalls



Intrusion-prevention systems at the hypervisor and/or VM level to detect and block unwanted traffic



Data-loss-prevention tools at the hypervisor and/or VM level



Controls to prevent out-of-band communications occurring via the underlying infrastructure



Isolation of shared processes and resources from client environments



Segmented data stores for each client



Strong, two-factor authentication



Separation of duties and administrative oversight



Continuous logging and monitoring of perimeter traffic, and real-time response

5 PCI DSS Compliance Challenges
Storing, processing, or transmitting cardholder data in the cloud brings that cloud environment into scope for
PCI DSS, and it may be particularly challenging to validate PCI DSS compliance in a distributed, dynamic
infrastructure such as a public or other shared cloud.
- Some of the technical controls and auditing processes traditionally used to attain a measurable level
of assurance in static environments (for example, in-house data storage servers) are not designed for rapidlychanging cloud environments and processes (for example, cloud bursting, continual deployment and
retirement of virtual machines, dynamic IP addressing, and so on).
- The distributed architectures of cloud environments add layers of technology and complexity that challenge
traditional assessment methods.
- Examples of compliance challenges include but are not limited to:


Clients may have little or no visibility into the CSP’s underlying infrastructure and the related security
controls.
- 

Some virtual components do not have the same level of access control, logging, and monitoring as their
physical counterparts.
- 

It can be challenging to collect, correlate, and/or archive all of the logs necessary to meet applicable PCI
DSS requirements.
- 

Many large providers might not support right-to-audit for their clients.
- These challenges will impact a number of factors related to how PCI DSS compliance is managed, including
how segmentation is implemented, how PCI DSS assessments are scoped, how individual PCI DSS
requirements are validated, and which party will perform particular validation activities.
- At a high level, CSPs can be identified as those that have been validated as meeting a particular level of PCI
DSS compliance and those that have not.
- Use of a PCI DSS compliant CSP does not result in PCI DSS compliance for the clients.
- The client therefore
must work with the CSP to ensure that evidence is provided to verify that PCI DSS controls are maintained on
an ongoing basis—an Attestation of Compliance (AOC) reflects a single point in time only; compliance
requires ongoing monitoring and validation that controls are in place and working effectively.
- Additionally, the client must still
maintain compliance for all of their own operations—for example, by ensuring anti-virus is installed and
updated on all client-side systems used to connect into the cloud environment.
- Similarly, a client’s PCI DSS compliance does not result in any claim of compliance for the CSP, even if the
client’s validation included elements of the service managed by the CSP.
- Regarding the applicability of one party’s compliance to the other, consider the following:
a) If a CSP is compliant, this does not mean that their clients are.
- CSPs that
have validated PCI DSS compliance may be included on a list published by a payment card brand or they
may not; either way, the client will need to obtain details of the CSP’s compliance validation in order to
determine whether the service they are using is wholly covered.
- The client must have a
detailed understanding of any security requirements that are not covered by the provider and are
therefore the client’s responsibility to implement, manage, and validate as part of their own PCI DSS
compliance.
- CSPs that have undergone an independent PCI DSS assessment to validate their compliance will have
the results summarized in an Attestation of Compliance (AOC) and detailed in a Report on Compliance
(ROC).
- CSPs that have undergone PCI DSS compliance assessment and validation should be able to provide
their clients with the following:


Proof of compliance documentation (such as the AOC and applicable sections from the ROC),
including date of compliance assessment



Documented evidence of system components and services that were included in the PCI DSS
assessment



Documented evidence of system components and services that were excluded from the PCI DSS
assessment, as applicable to the service



Appropriate contract language, if applicable
The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information.
- Information provided here does not replace
or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard.

20

Information Supplement • PCI DSS Cloud Computing Guidelines • February 2013

CSPs that have not undergone a PCI DSS compliance assessment will need to be included in their
client’s assessment.
- The client’s assessor may require onsite
access and detailed information from the CSP, including but not limited to:


Access to systems, facilities, and appropriate personnel for on-site reviews, interviews, physical walkthroughs, etc.



Policies and procedures, process documentation, configuration standards, training records, incident
response plans, etc.



Evidence (such as configurations, screen shots, process reviews, etc.) to show that all applicable PCI
DSS requirements are being met for the in-scope system components



Appropriate contract language, if applicable

The client and CSP will need to agree upon which assessment activities can be performed by the client
and which testing is the responsibility of the CSP.
- The CSP also needs to be able to provide clients with specific details as applicable to the ongoing
maintenance of PCI DSS compliance.
- For example, depending on the service provided, the CSP may
need to produce copies of log files, patch update records, or firewall rule-sets that specifically apply to an
individual client’s environment.
- This may help to simplify the compliance
validation process for both the CSP and for their individual clients.
- 6.1

Governance, Risk and Compliance
One of the primary challenges with cloud environments is that governance, compliance, and risk management
are typically shared between the client and CSP.
- Reporting and monitoring mechanisms should be made available to client organizations
to provide assurance that effective governance is applied by the CSP.
- However, the advent
of new technologies requires a reevaluation of traditional risk strategies.
- Identifying elements of the service that need to be clarified, and that need to be included in
contracts or service agreements
Due diligence is not simply reading the provider’s marketing material or relying on a provider’s claims of
“PCI compliance” or secure operations.
- The secure delivery of any cloud
service is dependent on the CSP’s personnel, processes, and technologies, while the secure usage of
cloud services remains the responsibility of the client.
- However, the client is ultimately responsible for ensuring the service
they’re using meets their security requirements and compliance obligations.
- PCI DSS compliance validation and testing activities (with the associated
controls, permissions, and schedules) should also be clearly detailed in the SLA.
- CSPs should have documented processes for responding to legal requests for seizure of
records, including data/audit logs belonging to the CSP and their clients.
- For example, operational data, security policies and procedures,
system configurations and build standards, log files, audit reports, authentication credentials, cryptographic
keys, incident response plans, and employee contact details are just some of the types of data with different
security requirements that may need to be considered.
- 6.4.2

Data storage and persistence
In addition to the known range of intended storage locations, data may also be present in other CSP
systems used for maintenance of the cloud infrastructure, such as VM images, backups, monitoring logs,
and so on.
- 6.4.3

Data lifecycle management
For all cloud models, clear requirements for data retention, storage and secure disposal should form an
integral part of the engagement process to ensure that sensitive data is:


Retained for as long as needed,



Not retained any longer than needed,



Stored only in appropriate and secured locations,

The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information.
- In a distributed cloud environment, verifying that all instances of cardholder data have been securely
deleted in accordance with the client’s data-retention policy is subject to the same challenges identified
above for validating data security and access controls.
- However, clients should be aware that leaving potentially
unknown quantities of encrypted data on CSP systems after their agreement has been terminated is likely
to be a violation of their data-retention policy.
- 6.5

Technical Security Considerations
Technical security considerations for cloud environments generally include all those that apply to virtualization
technologies, as well as those directly related to the different deployment and service models.
- 6.5.1

Evolving Security Technologies
As mentioned above, virtualization security considerations will also apply to cloud environments.

SSC website—that discuss security considerations for the use of virtual technologies.
- 6.5.3

Logging and Audit Trails
CSPs should be able to segregate log data applicable for each client and provide it to each respective
client for analysis without exposing log data from other clients.
- Additionally, the ability to maintain an
accurate and complete audit trail may require logs from all levels of the infrastructure, requiring
involvement from both the CSP and the client.
- For example, the CSP could manage system-level,
operating-system, and hypervisor logs, while the client configures logging for their own VMs and
The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information.
- In this scenario, the ability to associate various log files into meaningful events would require
correlation of client-controlled logs and those controlled by the CSP.
- Depending on the particular technology implemented, introspection can provide the CSP with a level of
real-time auditing of VM activity that may otherwise be unattainable.
- Two potential challenges with introspection are that it can bypass role-based access controls and it can
be used without leaving a forensic audit trail within the VM itself.
- For example, to view a data file, a user
typically authenticates to the VM, resulting in an authentication audit trail and ensuing the user’s access is
controlled according to their defined permissions.
- If file-access logging is enabled in the VM and the user
views a file, the access is recorded to show what was accessed by whom and when.
- As no
authentication to the VM itself is required, file access leaves no audit trail on the VM and the VM contains
no evidence that the file was accessed.
- In this example, the access would need to be logged via the
introspection tool itself, which would typically not be in the client’s control.
- For example, the ability to configure introspection auditing should not be available to
personnel with the ability to access hosted VMs via the introspection tool.
- CSPs using introspection should be able to provide their clients with all applicable introspection logs for
that client’s environment including, but not limited to, authentication details, disk and memory access
requests, and API calls.
- All introspection activity should be mapped to the individual user account
performing the activity, and logs should be reviewed on a continual basis to ensure the integrity and
confidentiality of client data has been maintained.
- For
example, a poorly-coded API could result in weak authentication protocols, poor access controls, and
limited auditing capability.
- The client will therefore need to ensure their client-side devices are appropriately secured
and protected from unauthorized physical and logical access.
- 6.6

Incident Response and Investigation
Clients need to know when an issue, incident, or breach has occurred and the impact to their environment
and/or to their data.
- Issues, incidents, and data breaches should be communicated by the CSP in a timely
manner.
- Clients should consider whether their CSP requires all clients to immediately notify the CSP of
potential breaches in their environments, allowing the CSP to respond more quickly to contain the breach and
minimize its impact to other clients.
- Definitions of what constitutes a breach or incident requiring notification between client and cloud provider
should be agreed.
- Notification processes and timelines should be included in SLAs, and incident response
plans should include notification requirements.
- The potential for client data to be captured by third parties
during a breach investigation should also be clearly understood.
- Investigating potential breaches in cloud environments brings additional challenges.
- For example,
compromised VM instances may be deactivated before anyone is aware that a breach occurred.
- It may be
nearly impossible to properly investigate a breach when the source of the breach is no longer in use or even
exists.
- It is therefore crucial that prior to
migrating payment card operations into a cloud environment, an organization engages their technical, legal,
due diligence, information security, and compliance teams to work together to define the client’s needs and
evaluate potential cloud service offerings against those needs.

What does the service provide with respect to security maintenance, PCI DSS compliance,
segmentation, assurance, and what is the client responsible for?

o

How will the CSP provide ongoing evidence that security controls continue to be in place and are
kept up to date?
- CSPs are encouraged to work with their clients to understand their security and compliance needs.
- The CSP may also define the retention periods.
