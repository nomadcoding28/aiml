1 Executive Summary
1

Cloud computing is a form of distributed computing that is yet to be standardized . There are a number of
factors to be considered when migrating to cloud services, and organizations need to clearly understand their
needs before they can determine if and how they will be met by a particular solution or provider. As cloud
computing is still an evolving technology, evaluations of risks and benefits may change as the technology
becomes more established and its implications become better understood.
Cloud security is a shared responsibility between the cloud service provider (CSP) and its clients. If payment
card data is stored, processed or transmitted in a cloud environment, PCI DSS will apply to that environment,
and will typically involve validation of both the CSP’s infrastructure and the client’s usage of that environment.
The allocation of responsibility between client and provider for managing security controls does not exempt a
client from the responsibly of ensuring that their cardholder data is properly secured according to applicable
PCI DSS requirements.
It’s important to note that all cloud services are not created equal. Clear policies and procedures should be
agreed between client and cloud provider for all security requirements, and responsibilities for operation,
management and reporting should be clearly defined and understood for each requirement.

software that provides the services, and delivers the cloud services through network access.



Cloud customer or client – The entity subscribing to a service provided by a cloud provider. May
include merchants, service providers, payment processors, and other entities utilizing cloud services. May
also be referred to as a cloud tenant.

2 Cloud Overview
Cloud computing provides a model for enabling on-demand network access to a shared pool of computing
resources (for example: networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly
3
provisioned and released with minimal management effort or cloud provider interaction.
Cloud computing can be used to provide clients with access to the latest technologies without a costly
investment in hardware and software. Due to the economies of scale associated with the delivery of cloud
services, CSPs can often provide access to a greater range of technologies and security resources than the
client might otherwise have access to. Client organizations without a depth of technically-skilled personnel
may also wish to leverage the skills and knowledge provided by CSP personnel to securely manage their
cloud operations.
Cloud computing therefore holds significant potential to help organizations reduce IT complexity and costs,
while increasing agility. Cloud computing is also seen as a means to accommodate business requirements for
high availability and redundancy, including business continuity and disaster recovery.

2.1

Deployment and Service Models
Deployment models are defined to distinguish between different models of ownership and distribution of the
resources used to deliver cloud services to different customers. Cloud environments may be deployed over a
private infrastructure, public infrastructure, or a combination of both. The most common deployment models,
as defined by NIST, include:


Private cloud – The cloud infrastructure is operated solely for a single organization (client). It may be
managed by the organization itself or a third-party provider, and may be on-premise or off-premise.
However, it must be solely dedicated for the use of one entity.



Community cloud – The cloud infrastructure is shared by several organizations and supports a specific
community with shared requirements or concerns (for example, business model, security requirements,
policy, or compliance considerations). It may be managed by the organizations or a third party, and may
be on-premise or off-premise.



Public cloud – The cloud infrastructure is made available to the general public or a large industry group
and is owned by an organization selling cloud services. Public cloud infrastructure exists on the premises
of the cloud provider.



Hybrid cloud – The cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more clouds (private, community, or
public) that remain unique entities but are bound together by technology to enable portability. Hybrid
clouds are often used for redundancy or load-balancing purposes—for example, applications within a
private cloud could be configured to utilize computing resources from a public cloud as needed during
peak capacity times (sometimes called “cloud-bursting”).

With respect to understanding roles and responsibilities, this paper is largely focused on public cloud
scenarios. However, many of the concepts discussed remain applicable to the other deployment models.

Service models identify different control options for the cloud customer and cloud provider. For example,
SaaS customers simply use the applications and services provided by the CSP, where IaaS customers
maintain control of their own environment hosted on the CSP’s underlying infrastructure.
4

The three most commonly used service models are described as follows :
Software as a Service (SaaS) – Capability for clients to use the provider’s applications running on a
cloud infrastructure. The applications are accessible from various client devices through either a thin
client interface, such as a web browser, or a program interface.
Platform as a Service (PaaS) – Capability for clients to deploy their applications (created or
acquired) onto the cloud infrastructure, using programming languages, libraries, services, and tools
supported by the provider.
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) – Capability for clients to utilize the provider’s processing,
storage, networks, and other fundamental computing resources to deploy and run operating systems,
applications and other software on a cloud infrastructure.
The main difference between service levels relates to how control is shared between client and CSP, which in
turn impacts the level of responsibility for both parties. It should be noted that, other than in a truly private
cloud (on-premise) scenario, the client rarely has any control over hardware, and it is the degree to which
virtual components, applications and software are managed by the different parties that differentiates the
service models. As a general rule, SaaS provides clients with the least amount of control, whereas IaaS offers
the most control for the client.
It’s important to note that these descriptions for deployment and service models, although widely accepted by
the industry, may not be universally followed by cloud providers or reflect actual cloud environments. For
example, a CSP might be selling a “private cloud” service that does not meet the intent of “private” as it is
described above. Similarly, the details of what is and what is not included in a particular service will probably
vary between CSPs, even if they each identify their service by the same term (IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS).
The level of security responsibility across the cloud service models generally migrates towards the client as
the client moves from a SaaS model (least client responsibility) to an IaaS model (most client responsibility).
The greatest level of responsibility for the CSP to maintain security and operational controls is present in the
SaaS service model.
Figure 1 on the following page shows how control is typically shared between the CSP and client across
different service models.

Figure 1: Level of control/responsibility for client and CSP across different service models

While clients may be attracted to the SaaS and PaaS models due to the resource savings and reduced
responsibility for administering the cloud environment, they should be aware that these models also
correspond to a greater loss of control of the environment housing their sensitive data. Contractual
agreements and ongoing due diligence become especially critical where control is outsourced, to ensure that
the required security measures are being met and maintained by the CSP for the duration of the agreement.

3 Cloud Provider / Cloud Customer Relationships
3.1

Understanding Roles and Responsibilities
The lines of accountability and responsibility will be different for each service and deployment model. Clear
policies and procedures should be agreed upon between client and cloud provider for all security
requirements, and clear responsibilities for operation, management and reporting need to be defined for each
requirement.

3.2

Roles and Responsibilities for Different Deployments Models
The entity performing the role of CSP will vary according to the type of deployment model. For example, the
CSP role may be assigned entirely to an external third party (as in a public cloud), or the role may be
undertaken by an internal department or business function (as in an on-premise private cloud). Similarly, the
role of CSP may be assigned to more than one entity in a community or hybrid cloud scenario.
To understand how responsibilities are assigned in a particular deployment model, consider the following:


Private cloud – Where a private cloud is managed on-premise, the CSP role may be undertaken within
the client organization. For example, the IT department could take on the role of CSP with various
operational departments as its clients. In this scenario, the client organization retains full control of their
environment and its security and compliance.
Dedicated, private clouds may also be provisioned off-premise by a third-party CSP. In this case, the
delineation of responsibility will also depend on the particular service model, as described in Section 3.3,
“Responsibilities for Different Service Models.”



Community cloud – The CSP could be one of the client organizations within the community or a
separate third party. The delineation of responsibility follows the particular service model implemented.



Public cloud – The CSP is a third party that is an organizationally-separate entity to its clients. The cloud
is deployed within a CSP’s environment and responsibility is delineated according to the particular service
model, as defined by the CSP.



Hybrid cloud – The CSP role may be assigned to both internal and third-party entities for different
elements of the overall cloud infrastructure. Responsibility will be assigned based on the combination of
deployment models and service models implemented.

The responsibility for implementation, operation, and management of security controls will be shared
differently within each of the cloud models, and needs to be clearly understood by both the client and CSP.
The client also needs to understand the level of oversight or visibility they will have into security functions that
are outside their control. If these security responsibilities are not properly assigned, communicated, and
understood, insecure configurations or vulnerabilities could go unnoticed and unaddressed, resulting in
potential exploit and data loss or other compromise.

The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace
or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard.

3.3

Responsibilities for Different Service Models
In all deployment models, and particularly in public cloud environments, it is important for all parties to
understand the specific elements of the service model used and its associated risks. Any cloud deployment
model that is not truly private (on-premise) is by nature a shared responsibility model, where a portion of
responsibility for the cloud service falls under the realm of the CSP, and a portion of responsibility also falls to
each client. The level of responsibility that falls to the CSP or the client is determined by the cloud service
model being utilized—that is, IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS. Clear delineation of responsibilities should be established
as a prerequisite to any cloud service implementation to provide a baseline for the cloud operation.
Figure 2 on the following page illustrates how control of the different technical layers is often shared across
different service models. For illustration purposes, different layers of the cloud stack are described as follows:
Layer

Description

Application Program Interface

The interface used by the client or their customers to interact with the

(API) or Graphical User

application. The current most common API is RESTful HTTP or

Interface (GUI)

HTTPS. The current most common GUI is an HTTP or HTTPS based
Web site.

Application

The actual application being used by one or more clients or their
customers.

Solution stack

This is the programming language used to build and deploy
applications. Some examples include .NET, Python, Ruby, Perl, etc.

Operating systems (OS)

In a virtualized environment, the OS runs within each VM. Alternatively,
if there is no underlying hypervisor present, the operating system runs
directly on the storage hardware.

Virtual machine (VM)

The virtual container assigned for client use.

Virtual network infrastructure

For communications within and between virtual machines

Hypervisor

When virtualization is used to manage resources, the hypervisor is
responsible for allocating resources to each virtual machine. It may
also be leveraged for implementing security.

Processing and memory

The physical hardware that supplies CPU time and physical memory.

Data Storage

The physical hardware used for file storage.

Network

This can be a physical or virtual network. It is responsible for carrying
communications between systems and possibly the Internet.

Physical facility

The actual physical building where the cloud systems are located.

Appendix B illustrates a sample inventory for cloud computing systems, as guidance for how
CSPs and their customers can document the different layers of the cloud environment.

Note: This table provides an example of how responsibilities might be assigned according to
common descriptions of the different service models. However, it’s important to note that the
technology layers and their corresponding lines of responsibility may be different for each CSP,
even if they use the same terminology to describe their service, and the individual service offerings
may or may not align with the responsibly assignments indicated above.
Some CSPs offer multiple “options” for their services—for example, a CSP may have one IaaS offering that
includes a client-controlled hypervisor and a separate IaaS offering with no client access to the hypervisor. It’s
imperative that clients and CSPs clearly document and understand where the boundaries are in their
particular relationship rather than assuming that any particular responsibility model applies to them.

The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace
or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard.

8

Information Supplement • PCI DSS Cloud Computing Guidelines • February 2013

Even where a client does not have control over a particular layer, they may still have some responsibility for
the configurations or settings that the CSP maintains on their behalf. For example, a client may need to define
firewall rules and review firewall rule-sets for those firewalls applicable to the protection of their environment,
even though the CSP actually configures and manages the firewalls. Similarly, clients may be responsible for
approving and reviewing user access permissions to their data resources, while the CSP configures the
access according to client needs.
The allocation of responsibility for managing security controls does not exempt a client from the responsibility
of ensuring that their cardholder data is properly secured.

3.4

Nested Service-Provider Relationships
Nested service-provider relationships are not uncommon in cloud scenarios, as CSPs sometimes rely on
other third-party companies to deliver their services. For examples, some CSPs use third-party storage
providers as part of their cloud service offering, while some might partner with other CSPs for redundancy or
fail-over as part of their cloud-delivery strategy.
Identifying all third-party relationships that the CSP has in place is important in order to understand the
potential ramifications to a client’s environment. The existence of multiple nested relationships—for example,
where there is a chain of vendors and/or other providers required for delivery of a cloud service—will also add
complexity to both the CSP’s and the client’s PCI DSS assessment process.

The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace
or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard.

4 PCI DSS Considerations
4.1

Understanding PCI DSS Responsibilities
The responsibilities delineated between the client and the CSP for managing PCI DSS controls are influenced
by a number of variables, including but not limited to:


The purpose for which the client is using the cloud service.



The scope of PCI DSS requirements that the client is outsourcing to the CSP.



The services and system components that the CSP has validated within its own operations.



The service option that the client has selected to engage the CSP (IaaS, PaaS or SaaS).



The scope of any additional services the CSP is providing to proactively manage the client’s compliance
(for example, additional managed security services).

The client needs to clearly understand the scope of responsibility that the CSP is accepting for each PCI DSS
requirement, and which services and system components are validated for each requirement. For example,
PCI DSS Requirements 6.1 and 6.2 address the need for vulnerabilities to be identified, ranked according to
risk, and deployed in a timely manner. If not properly defined, a client could assume that the CSP is managing
this process for the entire cloud environment, whereas the CSP could be managing vulnerabilities for their
underlying infrastructure only, and assuming that the client is managing vulnerabilities for operating systems
and applications.

4.2

PCI DSS Responsibilities for Different Service Models
As a general rule, the more aspects of a client’s operations that the CSP manages, the more responsibility the
CSP has for maintaining PCI DSS controls. However, outsourcing maintenance of controls is not the same as
outsourcing responsibility for the data overall. Cloud customers should not make assumptions about any
service, and should clearly spell out in contracts, memorandums of understanding, and/or SLAs exactly which
party is responsible for securing which system components and processes.
Figure 3 on the following page provides an example of how responsibilities for PCI DSS requirements may be
shared between clients and CSPs across the three service models. There will of course be exceptions and
variations across each individual service, and this table is provided as a guideline for clients and CSPs to help
plan discussions and negotiations.
Responsibilities have been identified as follows:


Client – Generally each client will retain responsibility for maintaining and verifying the requirement.



CSP – Generally the CSP will maintain and verify the requirement for their clients.



Both – Generally responsibility is “shared” between the client and the CSP. This may be due to the
requirement applying to elements present in both the client environment and the CSP-managed
environment, or because both parties need to be involved in the management of a particular control.

Appendix A includes additional considerations for determining how PCI DSS responsibilities may be
assigned for each service model.

The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace
or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard.

Note: The sample responsibilities illustrated in this table do not include consideration for any activities or
operations performed outside of a hypothetical cloud service offering. This table provides an example of
how PCI DSS responsibilities might be assigned for different service models. However, each CSP
ultimately defines their own service, and particular service offerings may or may not be consistent with
those illustrated above. Clients and CSPs should clearly document their responsibilities as applicable to
their particular agreement.
The concept of “shared” or “joint” responsibility can be a particular tricky path to navigate. While some
services and functions will be relatively straightforward to scope and establish boundaries, many services and
functions will overlap if not clearly demarcated at the outset of the service relationship.

or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard.

Information Supplement • PCI DSS Cloud Computing Guidelines • February 2013

Where the CSP maintains responsibility for PCI DSS controls, the client is still responsible for monitoring the
CSP’s ongoing compliance for all applicable requirements. CSPs should be able to provide their clients with
ongoing assurance that requirements are being met, and where the CSP is managing requirements on behalf
of the client, they should have mechanisms in place to provide the customer with the applicable records—for
example, audit logs showing all access to client data.
Clients are still required to validate their compliance in accordance with payment brand programs.
Appendix C illustrates a sample PCI DSS Responsibly Matrix, as guidance for how CSPs and
their customers can document PCI DSS responsibility assignments.
Appendix D includes Implementation Considerations for PCI DSS Requirements.

4.3

Security as a Service (SecaaS)
Security as a Service, or SecaaS, is sometimes used to describe the delivery of security services using a
SaaS-based delivery model. SecaaS solutions not directly involved in storing, processing, or transmitting
CHD may still be an integral part of the security of the CDE. As an example, a SaaS-based anti-malware
solution may be used to update anti-malware signatures on the client’s systems via a cloud-delivery model. In
this example, the SecaaS offering is delivering a PCI DSS control to the client’s environment, and the SecaaS
functionality will need to be reviewed to verify that it is meeting the applicable requirements.

4.4

Segmentation Considerations
Outside of a cloud environment, individual client environments would normally be physically, organizationally,
and administratively separate from each other. Clients utilizing a public or otherwise shared cloud must rely
on the CSP to ensure that their environment is adequately isolated from the other client environments.
In addition to enforcing separation between client environments, segmentation may also be desired within a
client’s environment to isolate their CDE components from non-CDE components in order to reduce their own
PCI DSS scope.
Segmentation on a cloud-computing infrastructure must provide an equivalent level of isolation as that
achievable through physical network separation. Mechanisms to ensure appropriate isolation may be required
at the network, operating system, and application layers; and most importantly, there should be guaranteed
isolation of data that is stored. Client environments must be isolated from each other such that they can be
considered separately managed entities with no connectivity between them. Any systems or components
shared by the client environments, including the hypervisor and underlying systems, must not provide an
access path between environments. Any shared infrastructure used to house an in-scope client environment
would be in scope for that client’s PCI DSS assessment.
A segmented cloud environment exists when the CSP enforces isolation between client environments.
Examples of how segmentation may be provided in shared cloud environments include, but are not limited to:


Traditional Application Service Provider (ASP) model, where physically separate servers are provided for
each client’s cardholder data environment.



Virtualized servers that are individually dedicated to a particular client, including any virtualized disks
such as SAN, NAS or virtual database servers.
The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace
or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard.

12

Information Supplement • PCI DSS Cloud Computing Guidelines • February 2013



Environments where clients run their applications in separate logical partitions using separate database
management system images and do not share disk storage or other resources.

The PCI DSS assessor must validate the effectiveness of the segmentation to ensure it provides adequate
isolation. If adequate segmentation is provided between clients, the client environment and the CSP-managed
environment and processes would be in scope for a client’s PCI DSS assessment. If adequate segmentation
is not in place or cannot be verified, the entire cloud environment would be in-scope for any one client’s
assessment. Examples of “non-segmented” cloud environments include but are not limited to:


Environments where organizations use the same application image on the same server and are only
separated by the access control system of the operating system or the application.



Environments where organizations use different images of an application on the same server and are
only separated by the access control system of the operating system or the application.



Environments where organizations’ data is stored in the same instance of the database management
system’s data store.

Without adequate segmentation, all clients of the shared infrastructure, as well as the CSP, would need to be
verified as being PCI DSS compliant in order for any one client to be assured of the compliance of the
environment. This will likely make compliance validation unachievable for the CSP or any of their clients.

4.4.1

Segmentation Challenges
Segmentation in traditional hosted environments can be applied via separate physical servers and
security measures applied using known methods. The difference in a cloud environment is that there are
common shared layers (such as hypervisors and virtual infrastructure layers), which can present a single
point of entry (or attack) for all systems above or below those shared layers. The security applied to these
layers is therefore critical not only to the security of the individual environments they support, but also to
ensure that segmentation is enforced between different client environments.
Once any layer of the cloud architecture is shared by CDE and non-CDE environments, segmentation
becomes increasingly complex. This complexity is not limited to shared hypervisors; all layers of the
infrastructure that could provide an entry point to a CDE must be included when verifying segmentation.
In a private cloud environment, one approach that may help reduce the complexity of segmentation
efforts could be to locate all CDE virtual components on a dedicated “CDE hypervisor,” and ensure all
non-CDE virtual components are located on separate hypervisors, adequately segmented from the CDE
hypervisor.
The need for adequate segmentation of client environments in a public or shared cloud is underscored by
the principle that the other client environments running on the same infrastructure are to be considered
untrusted networks. The client has no way of confirming whether other client environments are securely
configured, patched appropriately to protect against attack, or that they are not already compromised or
even designed to be malicious. This is particularly relevant where a CSP offers IaaS and PaaS services,
as the individual clients have greater control and management of their environments.

4.4.2

Segmentation Responsibilities
Ultimately, the CSP needs to take ownership of the segmentation between clients and verify it is effective
and provides adequate isolation between individual client environments, between client environments and
the CSP’s own environment, and between client environments and other untrusted environments (such
as the Internet). Applicable PCI DSS controls for the segmentation functions would also be the CSP’s
responsibility (for example, firewall rules, audit logging, documentation, reviews, etc.). The client is
responsible for the proper configuration of any segmentation controls implemented within their own
environment (for example, using virtual firewalls to separate in-scope VMs from out-of-scope VMs), and
for ensuring that effective isolation is maintained between in-scope and out-of-scope components.
Clients wishing to implement segmentation within their cloud environment also need to consider how the
CSP’s environment and processes may impact the effectiveness of the segmentation. For example, CSP
systems could be providing connectivity between the client’s own VMs that is not visible to the client.
Clients should also consider how the CSP manages offline or dormant VMs, and whether in-scope and
out-of-scope VMs could potentially be stored together by the CSP without active segmentation controls.

4.4.3

Segmentation Technologies
Traditional network segmentation technologies consist of hardware devices such as firewalls, switches,
routers, and so forth. These physical components could be used to separate VMs hosted on the same or
multiple hypervisors similar to the manner in which systems could be segmented in a “physical” network.
This would require hypervisors with multiple network interfaces and PCI DSS compliant configurations for
the various types of network hardware. Additionally, virtual counterparts of firewalls, switches and routers
now exist and can be incorporated into a virtual environment.
As mentioned above, a key consideration is how secure the “common layers” (such as hypervisors and
shared physical components) are, and whether they represent a potential attack surface between zones
or clients. The answer is that yes, they do; however the associated risks are still not well understood.
Examples of controls to be considered when evaluating segmentation options include, but are not limited
to:


Physical firewalls and network segmentation at the infrastructure level



Firewalls at the hypervisor and VM level



VLAN tagging or zoning in addition to firewalls



Intrusion-prevention systems at the hypervisor and/or VM level to detect and block unwanted traffic



Data-loss-prevention tools at the hypervisor and/or VM level



Controls to prevent out-of-band communications occurring via the underlying infrastructure



Isolation of shared processes and resources from client environments



Segmented data stores for each client



Strong, two-factor authentication



Separation of duties and administrative oversight



Continuous logging and monitoring of perimeter traffic, and real-time response

4.5

Scoping Considerations
Merchant or other organizations looking to store, process, or transmit payment card data in a cloud
environment should clearly understand the impact that extending their CDE into the cloud will have on their
PCI DSS scope. For example, in a private-cloud deployment, an organization could either implement
adequate segmentation to isolate in-scope systems from other systems and services, or they could consider
their private cloud to be wholly in scope for PCI DSS. In a public cloud, the client organization and CSP will
need to work closely together to define and verify scope boundaries, as both parties will have systems and
services in scope.
Appendix D includes Implementation Considerations for PCI DSS Requirements.
Recommendations for minimizing and simplifying PCI DSS scope in a cloud environment include:


Don’t store, process or transmit payment card data in the cloud. This is the most effective way to keep a
cloud environment out of scope, as PCI DSS controls are not required if there is no payment card data to
protect.



Implement a dedicated physical infrastructure that is used only for the in-scope cloud environment. The
scoping process will be simplified if all in-scope operations are limited to a known, defined set of physical
and virtual system components that are managed independently from other components. Once defined,
the client will be reliant on the CSP’s ability to ensure scope boundaries are maintained—for example, by
ensuring that all segmentation controls are operating effectively and that any new components connected
to the in-scope environment are immediately brought into scope and protected accordingly.



Minimize reliance on third-party CSPs for protecting payment card data. The more security controls the
CSP is responsible for, the greater the scope of the CDE will potentially be, thereby increasing the
complexity involved in defining and maintaining CDE boundaries.

Ensuring that clear-text account data is never accessible in the cloud may also assist to reduce the number of
PCI DSS requirements applicable to the cloud environment. As an example, let’s say the client performs all
5

encryption and decryption operations and all key-management functions in their own data center and uses a
third-party cloud only to store or transmit encrypted data. In this scenario, clear-text data would never exist in
the cloud environment—not even temporarily or in memory. Additionally, the cloud environment would never
have access to cryptographic keys or key-management processes.
It should be noted that the encrypted data is still in scope for PCI DSS (generally for the entity that controls or
6

manages the encrypted data and/or the cryptographic keys ) to ensure that applicable controls are in place.
However, by keeping all encryption/decryption and key-management operations isolated from the cloud, the
number of PCI DSS requirements that the CSP is required to maintain may be reduced, as these
requirements will instead be applicable to the client’s own environment and personnel. The CSP will still be in
scope for any PCI DSS requirements it manages on behalf of the client—for example, access controls
managed by the CSP will need to be verified to ensure that only authorized persons (as determined by the
client) have access to the encrypted data, and that access is not granted to unauthorized persons.

15

Information Supplement • PCI DSS Cloud Computing Guidelines • February 2013

Alternatively, if clear-text account data is present (for example, in memory) in the cloud environment, or the
ability to retrieve account data exists (for example, if decryption keys and encrypted data are present), all
applicable PCI DSS requirements would apply to that environment.

4.5.1

Scoping Examples for Different Deployment Models
For private cloud environments, segmentation efforts are focused on isolating CDE components from
non-CDE components to reduce the number of systems in scope for PCI DSS. In public or shared cloud
environments, segmentation between clients is critical for the security of the entire client environment,
and is additional to any segmentation managed by the client within their environment for the purposes of
scoping.
A number of simple scoping examples are presented here to provide guidance.

5 PCI DSS Compliance Challenges
Storing, processing, or transmitting cardholder data in the cloud brings that cloud environment into scope for
PCI DSS, and it may be particularly challenging to validate PCI DSS compliance in a distributed, dynamic
infrastructure such as a public or other shared cloud. For example, it can be difficult to identify which system
components are in scope for a particular service, or identify who is responsible for particular PCI DSS
controls. Some of the technical controls and auditing processes traditionally used to attain a measurable level
of assurance in static environments (for example, in-house data storage servers) are not designed for rapidlychanging cloud environments and processes (for example, cloud bursting, continual deployment and
retirement of virtual machines, dynamic IP addressing, and so on). Additionally, clients and assessors often
can’t “see and touch” CDE systems as they would in a traditional environment (for example, by visiting the
data center).
The distributed architectures of cloud environments add layers of technology and complexity that challenge
traditional assessment methods. For example, how does an assessor determine an appropriate sample size
for a dynamic cloud environment in which systems can appear and disappear in minutes?
Examples of compliance challenges include but are not limited to:


Clients may have little or no visibility into the CSP’s underlying infrastructure and the related security
controls.



Clients may have limited or no oversight or control over cardholder data storage. Organizations might not
know where cardholder data is physically stored, or the location(s) can regularly change. For redundancy
or high availability reasons, data could be stored in multiple locations at any given time.



Some virtual components do not have the same level of access control, logging, and monitoring as their
physical counterparts.



Perimeter boundaries between client environments can be fluid.



Public cloud environments are usually designed to allow access from anywhere on the Internet.



It can be challenging to verify who has access to cardholder data processed, transmitted, or stored in the
cloud environment.



It can be challenging to collect, correlate, and/or archive all of the logs necessary to meet applicable PCI
DSS requirements.



Organizations using data-discovery tools to identify cardholder data in their environments, and to ensure
that such data is not stored in unexpected places, may find that running such tools in a cloud environment
can be difficult and result in incomplete results. It can be challenging for organizations to verify that
cardholder card data has not “leaked” into the cloud.



Many large providers might not support right-to-audit for their clients. Clients should discuss their needs
with the provider to determine how the CSP can provide assurance that required controls are in place.

The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace
or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard.

18

Information Supplement • PCI DSS Cloud Computing Guidelines • February 2013

These challenges will impact a number of factors related to how PCI DSS compliance is managed, including
how segmentation is implemented, how PCI DSS assessments are scoped, how individual PCI DSS
requirements are validated, and which party will perform particular validation activities.
At a high level, CSPs can be identified as those that have been validated as meeting a particular level of PCI
DSS compliance and those that have not. The recommended practice for clients with PCI DSS considerations
is to work with CSPs whose services have been independently validated as being PCI DSS compliant.

5.1

What does “I am PCI compliant” mean?
Much stock is placed in the statement “I am PCI compliant”, but what does this actually mean for the different
parties involved?
Use of a PCI DSS compliant CSP does not result in PCI DSS compliance for the clients. The client must still
ensure they are using the service in a compliant manner, and is also ultimately responsible for the security of
their CHD—outsourcing daily management of a subset of PCI DSS requirements does not remove the client’s
responsibility to ensure CHD is properly secured and that PCI DSS controls are met. The client therefore
must work with the CSP to ensure that evidence is provided to verify that PCI DSS controls are maintained on
an ongoing basis—an Attestation of Compliance (AOC) reflects a single point in time only; compliance
requires ongoing monitoring and validation that controls are in place and working effectively.
Even where a cloud service is validated for certain PCI DSS requirements, this validation does not
automatically transfer to the client environments within that cloud service. For example, a CSP’s validation
may have included use of up-to-date anti-virus software on the CSP’s systems; however, this validation might
not extend to the individual client OS or VMs (such as in an IaaS service). Additionally, the client must still
maintain compliance for all of their own operations—for example, by ensuring anti-virus is installed and
updated on all client-side systems used to connect into the cloud environment.
Similarly, a client’s PCI DSS compliance does not result in any claim of compliance for the CSP, even if the
client’s validation included elements of the service managed by the CSP.
Regarding the applicability of one party’s compliance to the other, consider the following:
a) If a CSP is compliant, this does not mean that their clients are.
b) If a CSP’s clients are compliant, this does not mean that the CSP is.
c) If a CSP and the client are compliant, this does not mean that any other clients are.
The CSP should ensure that any service offered as being “PCI compliant” is accompanied by a clear and
unambiguous explanation, supported by appropriate evidence, of which aspects of the service have been
validated as compliant and which have not.

5.2

Verifying Scope of Validated Services and Components
Clients should first verify that the service they are using is the one that has been validated. CSPs that
have validated PCI DSS compliance may be included on a list published by a payment card brand or they
may not; either way, the client will need to obtain details of the CSP’s compliance validation in order to
determine whether the service they are using is wholly covered.
The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace
or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard.

19

Information Supplement • PCI DSS Cloud Computing Guidelines • February 2013

Considerations for the client may include:


How long has the CSP been PCI DSS compliant? When was their last validation?



What specific services and PCI DSS requirements were included in the validation?



What specific facilities and system components were included in the validation?



Are there any system components that the CSP relies on for delivery of the service that were not
included in the PCI DSS validation?



How does the CSP ensure that clients using the PCI DSS compliant service cannot introduce noncompliant components to the environment or bypass any PCI DSS controls?

CSPs should provide their clients with evidence that clearly identifies what was included in the scope of
their PCI DSS assessment, as well as the specific PCI DSS requirements that the environment was
assessed against, and the date of the assessment. All aspects of the cloud service not covered by the
CSP’s PCI DSS assessment should also be identified and documented, as these will need to be validated
either by the client or the CSP in order for a client’s assessment to be completed. The client must have a
detailed understanding of any security requirements that are not covered by the provider and are
therefore the client’s responsibility to implement, manage, and validate as part of their own PCI DSS
compliance.
CSPs that have undergone an independent PCI DSS assessment to validate their compliance will have
the results summarized in an Attestation of Compliance (AOC) and detailed in a Report on Compliance
(ROC). The Executive Summary and Scope of Work sections of the ROC should detail the scope of the
assessment including the specific components, facilities, and services that were assessed.

5.3

Verifying PCI DSS Controls Managed by the Cloud Provider
As with all hosted services in scope for PCI DSS, the client organization should request sufficient
evidence and assurance from their CSP that all in-scope processes and components under the
CSP’s control are PCI DSS compliant. This verification may be completed by the client’s assessor (such
as a QSA or ISA) as part of client’s PCI DSS assessment. If the CSP has already undergone a PCI DSS
assessment that was performed by another assessor, the client’s assessor will need to verify that the
CSP’s validation is current, that the assessment covered all services provided to or used by the client,
and that all applicable requirements were found to be in place for the environments and systems in
scope.
CSPs that have undergone PCI DSS compliance assessment and validation should be able to provide
their clients with the following:


Proof of compliance documentation (such as the AOC and applicable sections from the ROC),
including date of compliance assessment



Documented evidence of system components and services that were included in the PCI DSS
assessment



Documented evidence of system components and services that were excluded from the PCI DSS
assessment, as applicable to the service



Appropriate contract language, if applicable
The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace
or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard.

20

Information Supplement • PCI DSS Cloud Computing Guidelines • February 2013

CSPs that have not undergone a PCI DSS compliance assessment will need to be included in their
client’s assessment. The CSP will need to agree to provide the client’s assessor with access to their
environment in order for the client to complete their assessment. The client’s assessor may require onsite
access and detailed information from the CSP, including but not limited to:


Access to systems, facilities, and appropriate personnel for on-site reviews, interviews, physical walkthroughs, etc.



Policies and procedures, process documentation, configuration standards, training records, incident
response plans, etc.



Evidence (such as configurations, screen shots, process reviews, etc.) to show that all applicable PCI
DSS requirements are being met for the in-scope system components



Appropriate contract language, if applicable

The client and CSP will need to agree upon which assessment activities can be performed by the client
and which testing is the responsibility of the CSP. For example, in an IaaS/PaaS service, the client may
wish to test within their own environment and whatever else they can access, such as the boundaries
between themselves and other clients, or between themselves and the CSP’s systems. However, if such
testing is not permitted by the CSP, the client will have to rely on the CSP to perform and validate these
requirements. In SaaS environments, the client will have limited or no visibility or permission to perform
testing, and will generally be reliant on the CSP for all testing and validation. Defined testing activities and
their associated controls and permissions should be detailed in the SLA.
The CSP also needs to be able to provide clients with specific details as applicable to the ongoing
maintenance of PCI DSS compliance. For example, depending on the service provided, the CSP may
need to produce copies of log files, patch update records, or firewall rule-sets that specifically apply to an
individual client’s environment.
CSPs wishing to provide a PCI DSS compliant service may wish to consider isolating the PCI DSS
compliant services from their non-PCI compliant services. This may help to simplify the compliance
validation process for both the CSP and for their individual clients. It may also help the CSP to
standardize the PCI DSS compliant services being provided to their clients.

The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace
or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard.

6 Additional Security Considerations
While the use of cloud services can provide an attractive opportunity for organizations of all sizes to outsource
and utilize centrally-managed security resources, organizations should also be aware of the risks and
challenges associated with a particular cloud choice before moving their sensitive data or services into the
cloud environment. This section explores some of these additional security considerations.

6.1

Governance, Risk and Compliance
One of the primary challenges with cloud environments is that governance, compliance, and risk management
are typically shared between the client and CSP. This shared delineation of responsibilities emphasizes the
importance of a strong governance and risk-management structure. Without a clear governance strategy, the
client may be unaware of issues arising from use of the cloud service, and the CSP may be unaware of
issues within the client environment that could impact their service provision. A strategy for shared
governance and communication should be established between client and CSP to enable clear
communication of all aspects of the relationship from operational performance to security risk management
and issue resolution. Reporting and monitoring mechanisms should be made available to client organizations
to provide assurance that effective governance is applied by the CSP.

6.1.1

Risk Management
Consistent with a risk-management approach for in-house services, outsourced cloud services should be
assessed against an organization’s risk criteria with the intent of identifying critical assets, analyzing
potential vulnerabilities and threats to those assets, and developing an appropriate risk-mitigation strategy
(see PCI DSS Requirement 12.1.2). Lack of physical control of infrastructure, as occurs when the
environment is outsourced to a third-party CSP, renders a thorough risk-management process all the
more important.
In traditional environments, the physical location of sensitive data can be restricted to dedicated systems,
facilitating the identification and implementation of effective risk-mitigation controls. However, the advent
of new technologies requires a reevaluation of traditional risk strategies. For example, data in cloud
environments is no longer tied to a physical system or location, reducing the effectiveness of traditional
security mechanisms to protect data from risk. Traditional security approaches that build security controls
“around” sensitive data may therefore need to evolve to address this new risk environment.
Similarly, traditional forms of risk assessment might not take into consideration particular cloud
characteristics, such as a pay-as-you go model or multi-tenancy (described in Section 6.5.7), and may
therefore require new or modified procedures.

6.1.2

Due Diligence
A CSP that stores, processes, or transmits cardholder data on behalf of a client, provides a security
service for the protection of a client’s cardholder data, or could otherwise impact the security of a client’s
cardholder data, would be considered a third-party service provider of the client. As with all service
providers, clients should follow a thorough due-diligence process (see PCI DSS Requirement 12.8) prior

The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace
or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard.

22

Information Supplement • PCI DSS Cloud Computing Guidelines • February 2013

to engagement of the CSP. The specific due-diligence process and goals will vary for each client
organization, however common objectives typically include:
1. Confirming the provider has a history of sound work practices and ethical behavior and is
legitimately performing the services the client believes them to be
2. Verifying that the provider is compatible with the client’s business image and risk profile
3. Identifying potential risks or circumstances associated with the provider that may impact the client’s
operations or business
4. Identifying elements of the service that need to be clarified, and that need to be included in
contracts or service agreements
Due diligence is not simply reading the provider’s marketing material or relying on a provider’s claims of
“PCI compliance” or secure operations. Clients should be sufficiently assured that they are engaging with
a provider that can meet their security and operational needs before undertaking any such engagements.
The scope of the due-diligence exercise should consider, at a minimum, the topics discussed throughout
this document, as applicable to a client’s particular requirements.

6.1.3

Service Level Agreements (SLAs)
The use of cloud services includes the deployment of a defined service model and should always be
underwritten by comprehensive service level agreements (SLAs). The secure delivery of any cloud
service is dependent on the CSP’s personnel, processes, and technologies, while the secure usage of
cloud services remains the responsibility of the client.
Typically, cloud-hosting agreements are concerned with “up-time” and high availability, with little or no
mention or assurance of security. However, the client is ultimately responsible for ensuring the service
they’re using meets their security requirements and compliance obligations.
SLAs and other written agreements between the CSP and client should clearly identify the delineation of
responsibilities between parties, including responsibilities for implementing and managing different
security controls. These SLAs and agreements should be established as a prerequisite to any cloud
service implementation. PCI DSS compliance validation and testing activities (with the associated
controls, permissions, and schedules) should also be clearly detailed in the SLA.
Failure to develop and agree upon appropriate SLAs may result in issues for the client if the cloud service
does not meet the needs and demands of their business. SLAs should be established and agreed as part
of any contract and service negotiations. Performance, availability, integrity, and confidentiality should be
considered and SLAs agreed for each service managed and/or operated by the CSP. Written agreements
should also cover activities and assurances to be provided by both parties upon termination of the service
provision.

6.1.4

Business Continuity Plans and Disaster Recovery
Organizational requirements for business-continuity plans (BCP) and disaster recovery (DR) apply to the
client’s outsourced environments as they do for client-managed facilities. Clients should consider whether
the CSP’s continuity and recovery procedures are sufficient to meet the client’s organizational
requirements, and the PCI DSS scope of the cloud service should include any fail-over sites and systems
The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace
or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard.

23

Information Supplement • PCI DSS Cloud Computing Guidelines • February 2013

that might be used to store, process, or transmit cardholder data in BCP or DR situation, The ability to
perform tests of the BCP and DR capabilities and/or to observe results of the CSP’s testing should also
be considered.

6.1.5

Human resources
Management of the CSP’s human resources is largely out of the control of the client. The client’s duediligence processes should include an understanding of the CSP’s human resources and employee
engagement practices, as inappropriately or under-qualified personnel may expose data to unnecessary
risk. PCI DSS Requirement 12.7 provides a basis for assessing the recruitment process at the CSP.

6.2

Facilities and Physical Security
Cloud services are only “cloud” in concept. In reality, cloud services involve physical resources located at the
CSP environment which are accessed remotely from the client’s environment. Similarly to other third-party
providers, CSPs of public and shared clouds provide services to multiple clients whose data and virtual
components co-exist in the same physical location and on the same physical systems as other clients. Poor
physical security controls at a CSP facility may expose many clients’ data to unnecessary risk, and poor
environmental controls may impact the performance and integrity of the service provision.
In a private cloud, the physical location of all components is known and can be verified. When using a public
cloud, different elements of the environment, such as VMs, hypervisors, virtual network devices, etc., could be
frequently relocated according to the CSP’s load-balancing strategy. Verifying that appropriate physical
security is in place can be challenging in an environment where data and infrastructure can be in multiple
different locations at different times. A client should seek assurance that their physical security requirements
are consistently applied across all potential locations.

6.3

Data sovereignty and Legal considerations
Depending on the deployment and service model adopted, and due to the dynamic nature of cloud
operations, it may not be known where particular information actually resides. This may result in concerns
over data ownership and potential conflicts between domestic or international legal and regulatory
requirements. For example, the CSP’s infrastructure may result in data traversing or being stored in politically
or economically unstable countries.
Understanding the legal jurisdictions that apply to data in different countries or regions can be a challenge for
the client organization. For example, clients subject to regional laws restricting cross-border flows of data will
need to verify all locations and flows of their data to ensure their cloud service is compliant with their legal
obligations.
Other legal considerations include requirements for electronic discovery, evidence preservation and integrity,
and data custody. CSPs should have documented processes for responding to legal requests for seizure of
records, including data/audit logs belonging to the CSP and their clients. Clients should understand the
ramifications of such laws in the countries where their data exists, as well as the processes that their CSP will
engage in.

The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace
or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard.

24

Information Supplement • PCI DSS Cloud Computing Guidelines • February 2013

6.4

Data Security Considerations
Further to the data-sovereignty considerations mentioned above, public-cloud providers often have multiple
data storage systems located in multiple data centers, which may often be in multiple countries or regions.
Consequently, the client may not know the location of their data, or the data may exist in one or more of
several locations at any particular time. Additionally, a client may have little or no visibility into the controls
protecting their stored data. This can make validation of data security and access controls for a specific data
set particularly challenging.
It is recommended that data-security needs are evaluated for all types of information being migrated to a
cloud environment, not only cardholder data. For example, operational data, security policies and procedures,
system configurations and build standards, log files, audit reports, authentication credentials, cryptographic
keys, incident response plans, and employee contact details are just some of the types of data with different
security requirements that may need to be considered. If data security processes are not clearly defined and
documented, the data may be unintentionally exposed or subject to unnecessary risk that could result in loss
or inappropriate disclosure.

6.4.1

Data Acquisition
The client will ultimately determine how and when the cardholder data is acquired in the cloud
environment. End-to-end processes and data flows must be documented across both client and cloud
provider networks, so that it is clearly understood where cardholder data is located and how it is
traversing the infrastructure (see PCI DSS Requirement 1.1.2). This will also help the client and CSP to
identify where each entity acquires and relinquishes cardholder data throughout the process.

6.4.2

Data storage and persistence
In addition to the known range of intended storage locations, data may also be present in other CSP
systems used for maintenance of the cloud infrastructure, such as VM images, backups, monitoring logs,
and so on. Cardholder data stored in memory could also be written to disk for recovery or high availability
purposes (for example, in the case of virtual machine suspension or snapshot). Such stored data may
easily be “forgotten” and so not protected by data security controls. All potential capture points should be
identified and managed as necessary to prevent unintended or unsecured storage or transmission of
sensitive data. Specialized tools and processes may be needed to locate and manage data stored on
archived, off-line, or relocated images.
Potential hypervisor access to data in memory should also be taken into consideration, to ensure that
client-defined access controls are not unintentionally bypassed by CSP administrator personnel.

6.4.3

Data lifecycle management
For all cloud models, clear requirements for data retention, storage and secure disposal should form an
integral part of the engagement process to ensure that sensitive data is:


Retained for as long as needed,



Not retained any longer than needed,



Stored only in appropriate and secured locations,



Accessible only to those with a business need, and



Handled in accordance with the client’s security policy

(See PCI DSS Requirements 3, 7, and 10.7)
Because all environments outside the client-controlled environment could potentially be untrusted, cloud
services should support the secure transmission of cardholder data throughout the cloud infrastructure,
between the client and cloud environments, between client environments, and between the cloud
infrastructure and other public networks. It is recommended that sensitive data be encrypted for all
transmissions through any cloud environment that is not entirely private and/or controlled by the client.
Cloud environments outside of the client-controlled environment should be treated as “open” or “public”
networks (see PCI DSS Requirement 4.1).
In a distributed cloud environment, verifying that all instances of cardholder data have been securely
deleted in accordance with the client’s data-retention policy is subject to the same challenges identified
above for validating data security and access controls. Disposal of cardholder data must be conducted
using secure methods in accordance with PCI DSS requirements, and all locations of cardholder data
from within both the client and CSP environments need to be included. The disposal method should
ensure that data is not recoverable upon completion of the disposal process.

6.4.4

Data Classification
Data classification and the management of data according to its classification will vary from organization
to organization. A defined data-classification system can help organizations identify data that is sensitive
or confidential, and data with specific security needs. This in turn allows organizations to assign
appropriate protection mechanisms based on the security needs of different data types, and helps to
prevent sensitive data from being inadvertently mishandled or treated as non-sensitive.
Organizations should ensure that their particular data security needs can be met by the cloud service
before migrating that data into the cloud environment. Considerations should include how storing data
types with different levels of sensitivity in the same virtual environment may impact the protection levels
required for each data type. Cardholder data, user credentials and passwords, and cryptographic keys
are examples of sensitive data that must be protected according to their individual needs.

6.4.5

Data Encryption and Cryptographic Key Management
In a public-cloud environment, one client’s data is typically stored with data belonging to multiple other
clients. This makes a public cloud an attractive target for attackers, as the potential gain may be greater
than that to be attained from attacking a number of organizations individually. Strong data-level
encryption should be enforced on all sensitive or potentially sensitive data stored in a public cloud.
Because compromise of a CSP could result in unauthorized access to multiple data stores, it is
recommended that cryptographic keys used to encrypt/decrypt sensitive data be stored and managed
independently from the cloud service where the data is located. At a minimum, key-management servers
should be located in a separate network segment and protected with separate access credentials from
the VMs that are using the keys and the data encrypted with them.

The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace
or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard.

26

Information Supplement • PCI DSS Cloud Computing Guidelines • February 2013

Only defined, authorized key custodians should have access to cryptographic keys. Because access to
both keys and encrypted data provides the ability to decrypt the data, clients will need to verify who has
access to cryptographic keys, who has access to the encrypted data, and who has access to both. If a
client shares encryption keys with the CSP, or engages the CSP as a key custodian, details of CSP
access permissions and processes will also need to be reviewed and verified.
This consideration is particularly critical if cryptographic keys are stored or hosted by a third-party CSP
that also hosts the encrypted data. If CSP personnel have access to a client’s keys and the client’s
encrypted data, the client may have unintentionally granted the CSP ability to decrypt their sensitive data.
Any data that is decrypted in the cloud may be inadvertently captured in clear text in process memory or
VMs via cloud maintenance functions (such as snapshots, backups, monitoring tools, etc.). To avoid this
risk, clients may choose to keep all encryption/decryption operations and key management on their own
premises, and use a public cloud only for storage of the encrypted data. Applicable controls must be
applied to the encryption, decryption, and key-management processes to ensure data can only be
retrieved (decrypted) by those who are authorized with a defined business need.
CSPs providing cryptographic-key management services for their clients should ensure that secret or
private keys are not shared among clients—each client should be provided with a unique key or set of
keys. Secure channels for access to the cloud environment also require proper key management. If the
CSP uses images or cloning for protecting VMs, it is strongly recommended that keys not be cloned as
7

part of the VM image—each clone or VM instance should have its own key(s) .

6.4.6

Decommissioning and Disposal
In addition to data disposal, resource decommissioning requirements should be defined to support clients’
future decisions to migrate to a new CSP, decommission their cloud resources, or move out of a cloud
environment altogether. The CSP should provide data-disposal mechanisms that provide assurance to
the client that all data has been securely removed and deleted from the cloud environment. Procedures
for “termination of service” should be clearly defined and documented
Clients may choose to ensure that all data is encrypted with strong cryptography to reduce the risk to any
residual data left behind on CSP systems. However, clients should be aware that leaving potentially
unknown quantities of encrypted data on CSP systems after their agreement has been terminated is likely
to be a violation of their data-retention policy.

6.5

Technical Security Considerations
Technical security considerations for cloud environments generally include all those that apply to virtualization
technologies, as well as those directly related to the different deployment and service models.

6.5.1

Evolving Security Technologies
As mentioned above, virtualization security considerations will also apply to cloud environments. There
are many industry resources—including the PCI DSS Virtualization Guidelines, available from the PCI

The need for unique host keys has been well documented in a number of vendor technical papers.

Information Supplement • PCI DSS Cloud Computing Guidelines • February 2013

SSC website—that discuss security considerations for the use of virtual technologies. Some of these
considerations include:


It is difficult to maintain up-to-date, secure configurations on virtual machines when they are being
activated and deactivated in rapid cycles —virtual machines that are dormant for any period of time
may be improperly secured or introduce security vulnerabilities when activated.



Security and monitoring solutions for virtual networks are still evolving and are not as mature as those
available for physical networks.

Additionally, traditional security software and security device functions often do not scale well to a cloud
environment. For example:


Management of VM-to-VM traffic that does not pass through traditional network-based security
controls may require the use of additional host-based security controls to monitor and control the
traffic.



Traditional agent-based software security solutions that are not designed for virtualized environments
may cause operational issues. For example, software agents, such as those often used for anti-virus,
each use a small percentage of memory and processing resources; this can result in a large
overhead when multiple agents are installed on multiple VMs on the same host.



Scheduled scans or updates occurring simultaneously across multiple VMs may result in an extreme
load on the underlying system and reduce overall performance of all hosted VMs.

6.5.2

Identity and Access Management
Individual user identification and authentication for both CSP and client personnel is essential for access
control and accountability (see PCI DSS Requirements 7 and 8). Shared credentials (such as user
accounts and passwords) should not be used in the CSP environment—for example, for system
administration and maintenance—nor should generic or shared accounts be assigned to or used by
clients.
The use of a single client credential that covers multiple cloud services for that client is also a potential
concern. For example, let’s say a CSP issues a client with a user account and password that has
administrator privilege in one environment and user-level privilege for a separate, unrelated cloud service.
Compromise of the client’s user-level account in the second environment could therefore result in the
attacker gaining administrator-level access to the first environment. Client accounts and passwords
should be unique for each service, and any account with elevated privilege (such as administrator) should
be restricted for a specific service or function, and not used for activities or access that do not require
such privilege.

6.5.3

Logging and Audit Trails
CSPs should be able to segregate log data applicable for each client and provide it to each respective
client for analysis without exposing log data from other clients. Additionally, the ability to maintain an
accurate and complete audit trail may require logs from all levels of the infrastructure, requiring
involvement from both the CSP and the client. For example, the CSP could manage system-level,
operating-system, and hypervisor logs, while the client configures logging for their own VMs and

28

Information Supplement • PCI DSS Cloud Computing Guidelines • February 2013

applications. In this scenario, the ability to associate various log files into meaningful events would require
correlation of client-controlled logs and those controlled by the CSP.

6.5.4

Hypervisor Access and Introspection
In large cloud environments it can be difficult to keep track of which hypervisors are running which VMs,
as VMs can be dynamically assigned across a pool of hypervisors based upon load balancing needs.
Hypervisor configuration and access is particularly important as it provides a single point of entry to all its
VMs, and can potentially be used to gain access to sensitive data and resources on separate VMs.
An additional consideration is the degree to which the hypervisor is used to deliver security functionality to
the VMs. For example, a simple, hardened hypervisor may be very secure but offer limited security
capabilities, whereas a more complex, security-capable hypervisor with improved functionality could
8

potentially present a greater risk if compromised .
Functionality that allows the hypervisor to control and monitor individual VM activity from outside the VMs
9

is known as introspection . Hypervisor introspection expands the functionality of the hypervisor to allow a
deeper analysis of the data being processed by the VM, and typically includes visibility into stored data
files as well as monitoring of network traffic, memory and program execution, and other elements of the
VM.
Depending on the particular technology implemented, introspection can provide the CSP with a level of
real-time auditing of VM activity that may otherwise be unattainable. This can help the CSP to monitor for
and detect suspicious activity within and between VMs. Additionally, introspection may facilitate cloudefficient implementations of traditional security controls—for example, hypervisor-managed security
functions such as malware protection, access controls, firewalling and intrusion detection between VMs.
Two potential challenges with introspection are that it can bypass role-based access controls and it can
be used without leaving a forensic audit trail within the VM itself. For example, to view a data file, a user
typically authenticates to the VM, resulting in an authentication audit trail and ensuing the user’s access is
controlled according to their defined permissions. If file-access logging is enabled in the VM and the user
views a file, the access is recorded to show what was accessed by whom and when.
With introspection, files can be accessed from within the privileged state of the hypervisor. As no
authentication to the VM itself is required, file access leaves no audit trail on the VM and the VM contains
no evidence that the file was accessed. In this example, the access would need to be logged via the
introspection tool itself, which would typically not be in the client’s control. While this may be less of an
issue within a private cloud environment, it is an important consideration for clients of public cloud
services.
Additionally, since introspection is designed to have full visibility into each VM, it may be difficult to restrict
such access to only specific files or programs in memory. Any personnel (for example, CSP employees or
possibly other hosted clients) with access to the introspection function could potentially have access to
data and processes on any VM running on that hypervisor. Introspection access must therefore be
carefully managed, controlled and monitored to ensure that role-based access and segregation of duties

Information Supplement • PCI DSS Cloud Computing Guidelines • February 2013

is maintained. For example, the ability to configure introspection auditing should not be available to
personnel with the ability to access hosted VMs via the introspection tool.
CSPs using introspection should be able to provide their clients with all applicable introspection logs for
that client’s environment including, but not limited to, authentication details, disk and memory access
requests, and API calls. All introspection activity should be mapped to the individual user account
performing the activity, and logs should be reviewed on a continual basis to ensure the integrity and
confidentiality of client data has been maintained.
Where introspection is used by a third-party CSP, the clients may wish to consider implementing datalevel security controls (such as strong cryptography with all key storage and encryption/decryption
operations external to the cloud service) to avoid exposing sensitive data to the enhanced monitoring
features that introspection provides.

6.5.5

Security of Interfaces and APIs
Application programming interfaces (APIs) and other software interfaces are an integral component of
cloud computing, supporting interoperability and rapid delivery of cloud services. APIs can be configured
to provide access to a variety of functions, allowing clients and CSPs to interact and manage their
interactions within the cloud service.
As web services and APIs are by nature publicly accessible, their security is critical to the security of the
resources they provide access to. If not properly developed, managed, and secured, these interfaces can
be exploited or compromised, resulting in unexpected behavior and potentially unauthorized access. For
example, a poorly-coded API could result in weak authentication protocols, poor access controls, and
limited auditing capability. Such weaknesses could lead to the exposure of authentication credentials and
other sensitive data. If the APIs are not properly secured, they could also be exploited or altered by an
attacker to redirect data flows or alter application behavior.
APIs and other public interfaces should be designed to prevent both accidental misuse and malicious
attempts to bypass security policy. Strong authentication and access controls, strong cryptography, and
real-time monitoring are examples of controls that should be in place to protect these interfaces.

6.5.6

Security of Client Systems
Client systems used to access the cloud environment should not be overlooked, as they could potentially
become a weak point in a client’s cloud security strategy. Client organizations need to ensure their
systems and internal processes do not provide unauthorized access to the cloud environment. For
example, if a client workstation or other device is compromised, an attacker may be able to use legitimate
credentials and an authorized channel to gain access to the cloud environment from the compromised
client system. The client will therefore need to ensure their client-side devices are appropriately secured
and protected from unauthorized physical and logical access. Client-side systems used to access
cardholder data in the cloud would also be in scope for all applicable PCI DSS requirements.

The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace
or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard.

30

Information Supplement • PCI DSS Cloud Computing Guidelines • February 2013

6.5.7

Multi-tenancy
In a multi-tenant cloud environment, client organizations generally have no knowledge of the other clients
with whom they share resources (for example, virtual infrastructure, data stores, etc.), or how other clients
are securing (or not securing) their environments that access the shared resources.
Whether unsavory clients can pose a risk to other clients using the same provider will largely depend on
the controls the CSP has in place to segregate clients from one another, and to monitor and detect
suspicious activity on the shared infrastructure and between client environments. Before engaging with a
CSP, clients should consider how the CSP verifies that their clients are who they say they are, and how
the CSP detects potentially suspicious behavior once the clients are onboard. Clients should also ask the
CSP what controls they have in place to ensure that the security posture of one client cannot affect the
security posture of another client.

6.6

Incident Response and Investigation
Clients need to know when an issue, incident, or breach has occurred and the impact to their environment
and/or to their data. Issues, incidents, and data breaches should be communicated by the CSP in a timely
manner. Clients should consider whether their CSP requires all clients to immediately notify the CSP of
potential breaches in their environments, allowing the CSP to respond more quickly to contain the breach and
minimize its impact to other clients.
Definitions of what constitutes a breach or incident requiring notification between client and cloud provider
should be agreed. Notification processes and timelines should be included in SLAs, and incident response
plans should include notification requirements. The potential for client data to be captured by third parties
during a breach investigation should also be clearly understood.
Investigating potential breaches in cloud environments brings additional challenges. For example,
compromised VM instances may be deactivated before anyone is aware that a breach occurred. It may be
nearly impossible to properly investigate a breach when the source of the breach is no longer in use or even
exists.

7 Conclusion
In addition to the business and risk considerations, the implementation of security controls in a cloud
environment may require specialized technical knowledge and skills. It is therefore crucial that prior to
migrating payment card operations into a cloud environment, an organization engages their technical, legal,
due diligence, information security, and compliance teams to work together to define the client’s needs and
evaluate potential cloud service offerings against those needs.
Regarding third-party or public clouds, clients should consider that while they can outsource the day-to-day
operational management of the data environment, they retain responsibility for the data they put in the cloud.
Clients are encouraged to “shop around” until they find a CSP who can provide the level of security and
assurance they require. Potential clients are encouraged to:


UNDERSTAND your risk and security requirements first.



CHOOSE a deployment model that aligns with your security and risk needs.



EVALUATE different service options.



KNOW what you want from your CSP.



COMPARE providers and service offerings.



ASK questions of the CSP and verify the responses, for example:
o

What does each service consist of exactly, and how is the service delivered?

o

What does the service provide with respect to security maintenance, PCI DSS compliance,
segmentation, assurance, and what is the client responsible for?

o

How will the CSP provide ongoing evidence that security controls continue to be in place and are
kept up to date?

o

What will the CSP commit to in writing?

o

Are other parties involved in the service delivery, security, or support?



DOCUMENT everything with your provider in written agreements—for example, SLAs / Terms of Service
contracts, etc.



REQUEST written assurances that security controls will be in place and maintained.



REVIEW the service and written agreements periodically to identify if anything has changed.

CSPs are encouraged to work with their clients to understand their security and compliance needs. Both
parties should be willing to maintain open communication and monitoring to avoid any misunderstandings or
gaps in security responsibilities.

The questions in this appendix are intended as suggestions to help start conversations between clients and CSPs in order to understand the
characteristics of a particular cloud environment, which may in turn help determine if and how PCI DSS requirements can be met in that
environment. These questions alone will not determine whether or not applicable PCI DSS requirements can be met, however, they may be a
useful addition to questions directly related to specific PCI DSS requirements.
